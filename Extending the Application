The application is designed to be open for extension. You can easily add more attributes to questions, additional distribution criteria, or integrate with a database for scalability.
Adding More Attributes to Questions
Edit the Question class in app.js to add new attributes:
class Question {
  constructor(question, subject, topic, difficulty, marks, newAttribute) {
    // ... (unchanged)
    this.newAttribute = newAttribute;
  }
}
Additional Distribution Criteria
Modify the QuestionPaperGenerator class in app.js to handle additional distribution criteria:
class QuestionPaperGenerator {
  // ... (unchanged)
  generateQuestionPaper(totalMarks, difficultyDistribution, newDistributionCriteria) {
    // ... (update the generation logic)
  }
}
Database Integration
Consider integrating a database to store and retrieve questions for better scalability. Update the QuestionStore class or introduce a database layer as needed.
